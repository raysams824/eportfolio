  <b>APPRECIATION MESSAGE</b>

<p class="content">
This page enables me to express my gratitude to those who have provided guidance for me during the second quarter. First of all, I would like to thank our teacher, Ms. Uminga for making collaborations with other subjects in order to reduce the workload of us students. We are able to focus more on upcoming tests instead of more homework. I truly appreciate these simple acts with great impact. Thank you for being so generous and patient with us and allowing us to have a full stomach while learning in your class.

Thank you to my friends for the motivation and moral support to continue my academic journey. Thank you for giving me inspiration and suggestions on my most colorless days. I'm truly glad to have such great friends and I could never ask for more. I appreciate all of your support may it be the smallest or biggest achievements I have.
