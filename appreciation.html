This page is all about expressing my gratitude to those who helped me in this academic quarter. I would like to thank our teacher, Ms. Uminga for always giving us students a chance to complete and retake any missed activities related or not to ICT. Thank you Ma'am for being able to provide us with knowledge we can use to make the subject easier. Thank you for always being so generous with your time and giving us more than enough chances to submit late outputs. Thank you for being such a kind and generous teacher to us students to make our lives easier.<br><br>
Thank you to all my friends who helped me with some assignments or projects by guiding me on what techniques I can do to make my outputs better. My friends have also given me the moral support to charge me up and motivate me to do things I feel lazy to do or things I don't think I can do. Thank you for always motivating me through mentally difficult times.
