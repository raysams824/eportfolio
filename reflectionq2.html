  <b>REFLECTION</b>
</p>

<p class="content">
In the second quarter, I've noticed improvements in terms of discipline and balance. I see myself studying more often and completing tasks earlier to help me focus on what's coming next. I try to do better when it comes to managing my time for homework, tests, and other hobbies. Although my discipline and time management has improved, there are still multiple flaws and so much room for improvement 
<br><br>
As the first half of this academic quarter comes to an end, I want to make sure that the second half will do much better. I want to see myself filling in the patches to develop a much more better version of myself. By combining my experiences not just from the first and second quarter, but also grade 7 and 8, I will make sure of my enhancement in all aspects in order to achieve a good present and future.
